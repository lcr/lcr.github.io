  <p class="page-about-p">Hello there.</p>

  <p class="page-about-p">
    My name is Leslie Lai and I am a Front-end Developer living in Guangzhou.
    For now,my focus is on the Front-end foundations like CSS and JavaScript.

  <p class="page-about-p">
    As you can see this blog mixes Chinese and English,but I don't think there is any problem,
    who doesn't know a few English words now? By the way,it was built to learn Front-end Development and English for me.
