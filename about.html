        <p class="page-about-p">Hello there.</p>

        <p class="page-about-p">
            My name is Leslie Lai,and I am a Front-end Developer living in Guangzhou.
            For now,my focus is on the Front-end foundations like CSS and JavaScript.

            As you can see this blog mixes Chinese and English,but I don't think there is any problem,
            who doesn't know a few English words now? By the way,it was built to learn Front-end Development and English
            for me.

            Beside coding, my passions are plant(due to lack of place,only succulents are currently planted)
            and movie.Sometimes I will go out and take pictures with a sony mirrorless camera.
